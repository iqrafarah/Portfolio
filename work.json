One interesting feature we added was the ability to dictate notes using voice input and play them back. This feature allowed users to speak their notes, which would then be converted to text and stored. Additionally, users could listen to the recorded notes for playback. It was an engaging functionality that introduced a unique way of creating and interacting with notes in the app.",
